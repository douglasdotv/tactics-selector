# MZ Tactics Selector

[Greasy Fork page](https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/467712-mz-tactics-selector).

This is a userscript designed specifically for the game [ManagerZone](https://www.managerzone.com/). It enhances user experience by introducing a dropdown menu on the tactics page, allowing the user to quickly switch between different tactics without going through the hassle of moving players around. Additionally, it leverages the Greasemonkey API to save the tactics to the browser local storage so they are persisted between sessions. That way, a user can save, update and remove their favorite tactics without relying on the default ones provided after installation.

In order to install MZ Tactics Selector, you need a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). Once you have one in your browser, you can install the userscript via [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/467712-mz-tactics-selector).
